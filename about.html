    Hi my name is Giovanni. 
  I'm the creator and programmer for this website. I love drawing, photography, and writing.  
  My hobbies are drawing, animating, playing video games, coding, saving the planet from alien invasions,
  and eating sandwiches with my pet rock.
    
  I like going on walks to the kitchen to prepare the sandwiches for my pet rock and myselfmyself,
  Apples are my favorite berry, and I have a pet rock named Xx_Ya bOi Rockieeeee_xX. 
  Xx_Ya bOiRockieeeee_xX enjoys playing Call of Duty whilst eating a sandwich which I have prepared for him.
