    Hi my name is Giovanni. 
  I'm the creator and programmer for this website. I love drawing, photography, and writing.  
    <br/><br/>
  My hobbies are drawing, animating, playing video games, coding, saving the planet from alien invasions,
  and eating sandwiches with my pet rock.
    <br/>
  I like going on walks to the kitchen to prepare the sandwiches for my pet rock and myselfmyself,
  Apples are my favorite berry, and I have a pet rock named Xx_Ya bOi Rockieeeee_xX. 
    <br/><br/>
  Xx_Ya bOi Rockieeeee_xX enjoys playing Call of Duty whilst eating a sandwich which I have prepared for him.
    Xx_Ya bOi Rockieeeee_xX is my best friend. Every night I tuck Xx_Ya bOi Rockieeeee_xX into bed and sing him Eye of the Tiger
    (it's his favorite song from the Rocky movies).</p>

  If you though anything after video games on the list was true then...well...I don't know what to say to you.
